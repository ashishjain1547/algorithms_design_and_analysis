<pre>
I have some test cases for this code.
I don't want to run it as is. I want to modify it to run test cases from the input files and produces these three things:

import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.readline

T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):
    X = int(input())
    
    k = (math.isqrt(1 + 4*X) - 1) // 2
    print(X - k)

~~~

correct_count: <int>
incorrect_count: <int>
incorrect_instances:
[{
"in": ***
"correct_output": ***
"your_output": ***
}...]

Input Test Case file is: /home/jain/Downloads/tc1/in1.txt
Correct Output: /home/jain/Downloads/tc1/out1.txt

Input file format:
The first line contains the integer T, the number of test cases.
In next T lines, each line contains an integer X.

Rewrite the code with the above said requirements.
